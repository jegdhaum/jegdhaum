# ðŸŒ¿ Hey, I'm Jennifer

I like making small, strange, and sometimes useful things on the internet.  
Mostly experimenting, occasionally shipping. Always learning.

## ðŸ§© What I do

- Tinker with web interfaces and static sites  
- Build tools no one asked for but someone might need  
- Explore the boundaries between code, creativity, and chaos  

## ðŸ§ª Side interests
- Digital minimalism & privacy
- Old web aesthetics
- Static site generators
- Markdown everywhere

## ðŸ“Ž Currently learning
- TypeScript basics  
- How not to over-engineer everything  
- Living with less code

You probably won't find me on social media,  
but feel free to open an issue or fork something weird.
